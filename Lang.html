		Spanish in Mass Academy is a full immersion class, meaning that we can only speak in Spanish. In Mass Academy, there are two sections for Spanish, one for advanced students who had a strong background coming into the school, and one for intermediate students who may not have had as strong of a background in Spanish. In spanish class, we do many fun activities, such as playing games and making movies, in order to get a better grasp of the subject.
