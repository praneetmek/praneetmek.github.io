		Our math class is a math modeling course. Math modeling problems take regular, everyday problems, and adds a mathematical twist. Generally, math modeling problems dont have a correct solution- it depends on what constraints are set. Our class is set up so that we solve problems in groups, and present them on the board.

				<h2>HiMCM</h2>
				HiMCM was a 36 hour math competition that we participated in. During HiMCM, we get two math modeling problems, and we can choose whichever one we want to do. We then proceed to work on whichever problem we choose for 36 hours, writing up our solutions and techniques. (Click to view finished paper).

				<h2>Mathematica Lab 11</h2>
				Mathematica is a powerful math tool which allows the user to perform various different functions. In class, we do many mathematica labs to learn how to use the tool. This was one of the labs that we had to do. (Click to see pdf of the file).
