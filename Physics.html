		Physics class is probably the one class that is most similar to a regular school. In physics, we generally take notes at home and discuss the notes the next day in class. We also periodically get assigned practice problems to work on in class and at home. We also do many labs, and have to write them up.

				<h2>Uber Pulley</h2>
				As part of our force unit, we did a problem called the "uber pulley problem". This was a similar style to the other assignments we got, but on a much higher level. We had to apply multiple different concepts we learned in class to solve the problems.

				<h2>Penny Drop Lab</h2>
				As part of our kinematics unit, we did a lab to calculate the experimental acceleration of gravity. The lab consisted of dropping a penny from different heights and measuring the time it took for the penny to fall to the ground. (Click here to see lab write up)
