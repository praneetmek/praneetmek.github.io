	<p id="description">
		In our Computer Science course, a majority of A term was spent working on these websites. We learned HTML and CSS mostly by trial. During B term, we studied various concepts in java, using Eclipse as our IDE. those of us who passed a diagnostic test given at the beginning of the year have been working on independent projects instead. My independent project is a video game. I started by coding a simple Mario level, and expanded on that.

				<h2>Apps For Good</h2>
				For half of C term and all of D term, we worked on a project called Apps For Good. The goal was to create an android application that would somehow benefit society. My group, consisting of <object><a href="">Andrea Mechery</a></object> and <object><a href="">Hava Kantrowitz</a></object> created an app that would allow a user to track the competitions that their child is participating in. Over the course of three months, we worked together to design and build the app called Trophy Time, and presented our app at the Mass Academy App Fair. (Click to view poster from the fair).
