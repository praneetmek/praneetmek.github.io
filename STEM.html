		STEM is an independent research course. At Mass Academy, every student must complete a STEM Project by February, and present it to a board of judges. In class, we discuss and work on general parts of our project, while at home, we do the more specific things. We also meet with our mentors once a week.

				<h2>Poster File</h2>
				During our school fair, which we call "December Fair", we had to make posters and a presentation. On my poster, I made slides with information about my project. (Click to view slides)

				<h2>Materials and Methods</h2>
				As part of our STEM thesis, which we have to complete by February fair, we have to do a Materials and Methods section, which is a detailed description of the steps which we took to complete our project. (Click to view)

				<h2>STEM Thesis</h2>
				Our STEM project concluded with a fair in February. By that time, we completed an entire thesis for that project. My project analyzed the mechanical properties of various biomaterials and compared them to the mechanical properties of natural tissue. For the course of three months, I worked in a lab in WPI with Professor Jeannine Coburn and grad student Elizabeth Van Zyl. (Click to view thesis).

			<h2>STEM II</h2>
			STEM II was a group project in which we had to create assistive technologies for clients at a facility called Seven Hills. Our specific project was to create a lunchbox that could be opened with one hand for a client with Hemiplegia- a condition that paralyzes half of a person's body. After the end of STEM I, we went on a trip to Seven Hills to get a general idea of what the conditions of our clients were like. Afterwards, we had multiple different design reviews to mark our progress throughout the project. Below is a picture of our final product. (Click here to visit the instructables page to learn how to make the lunchbox).
