					My name is Praneet Mekala. I was born in Manchester, NH on November 15th, 2000. After about a year of living there, my family and I moved to Nashua, NH for a few months. Then, we moved again into a little apartment in Leominister, MA for about 2 years. When I was 4, we moved once again to Shrewsbury, MA, where I live now. I live with my parents and older brother named Satwik Mekala, who graduated from AMSA and is currently a member of the Georgia Tech Class of 2020.

			I am currently a student at the <span><a class="link" href="http://www.massacademy.org/">Massachusetts Academy of Math and Science (MAMS)</a></span>. Before Mass Academy, I attended the <span><a class="link" href="http://amsacs.org/">Advanced Math and Science Academy (AMSA)</a></span>. I went there for 5 years, 	from 6th grade to 10th grade. I came to Mass Academy because I heard of a strong STEM program and was interested.

								Usually, most of my free time is spent playing piano. I have been playing piano for about 4 years, where the first 3 were self-taught. I've learned to play a variety of songs, from classical to modern. I also enjoy listening to music, particularly rock, although I listen to almost all styles of music.

					I enjoy travelling a lot. Every two years, I go to India to visit the rest of my family, such as grandparents and cousins. Other than that, I mostly travel within the country. Every summer, my family and I go around the country, seeing popular tourist attractions in each state. So far, I have visited 40 states

			 I have been participating math team since 5th grade. I have been a very active member of the teams, entering almost every competition that I was able to. In 5th grade, I competed as a member of the Sherwood Middle School unofficial mathcounts team (5th graders were not allowed to compete officially). In 6th grade, my math interest really started to grow. I joined AMSA’s middle school math team, but I was not as good at solving problems as the other people around me. However, as the years passed, I got better and better, and by high school, I was put onto AMSA’s best team, and we went on to win both the state and New England championships in both my 9th and 10th grade years. I am also a member of Western Mass ARML, a team that competes in various different competitions throughout America. Finally, during the last summer, I attended the PROMYS Summer program, a mathematics research program for high school students.

			Pi Day Math Competition is a math competition run by Mass Academy and AMSA. For the past two years, members of both schools have worked together to create a math competition for middle school students to compete in. This year, I was the head problem writer for the competition. This entailed writing up problems as well as choosing which problems out of a list of 200 would be used for the actual competition. On the day of the competition, I helped around, making sure everything was working in an orderly fashion.

			Ever since freshmen year in high school, I have been volunteering at my sending school's middle school math team. In 9th grade, I volunteered alongside other upperclassmen. Because it was my first year volunteering, I mainly just did simple tasks such as passing out papers. In sophomore year, I started explaining problems on the board to the middle school students, teaching them various new concepts. Finally, in junior year, I started running the middle school practices, organizing different activities for the kids. I was able to gauge all the students' strengths and weaknesses and model my practices around the students, rather than just giving them random problems to solve. I spend roughly 50 hours per year volunteering for the team, between proctoring four hour long math meets to coaching the kids during practice.
